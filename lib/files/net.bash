#    @c 1 on error \n
#    @c 2 if file was already downloaded and was not downloaded 
#         again (--no-clobber option was passed)
# 
# @note Output of the `wget` command is forced to be redirected
#    to the log file and so caller cannot configre it to print
#    log messages to the stderr via options. It is still possible
#    though to make the progress bar visible with --show-progress 
#    switch
# 
# @note If many files would be downloaded by `wget`, only location
#    of the first one is returned to the stdout
